ARTIST INFORMATION RUNNER

My first experiment in using the Strategy design pattern described in "Head First Design Patterns" by Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson.
The Strategy pattern enables you to use composition for behaviours that will change, and inheritance for behaviours that you that you don't expect to.

There are three design principles considered.
Design Principle #1: "Encapsulate what varies"
Design Principle #2: Program to an interface, not an implementation.
Design Principle #3: Favour composition over inheritance.

Compile the code and run the main method in ArtistInformationRunner.

The program output is:
